# Level Editing
Here you can find 3 code templates you can use to import and customize your level in Sonic Adventure 2. 

To use these templates, please follow the [Create a DLL Mod](https://github.com/X-Hax/SA2BModdingGuide/wiki/Create-a-DLL-Mod) tutorial,
and instead of using the boilerplate code given there, use any of the three templates in this folder.

## Easy Replacement Method
If you are a beginner, and would like to make minor adjustments to your level that require coding, please use the
[Easy Replacement Method](https://github.com/X-Hax/SA2BModdingGuide/blob/master/Level%20Editing/Level%20Replacement%20(easy%20method).cpp).
This is also the main method the My Level Mod uses to import levels into the game.

## Advanced Replacement Method
If you would like to delve deeper and add more sophisticated things into your level like loops, rails, and more, please use the
[Advanced Replacement Method](https://github.com/X-Hax/SA2BModdingGuide/blob/master/Level%20Editing/Level%20Replacement%20(advanced%20method).cpp).
It comes pre-loaded with examples of more advanced functions and shows good coding style. Its recommended that if you're introducing many custom elements
to your level that you seperate each feature into its own function so the code is easier to upkeep. For real-world examples of advanced features being
added to a level, feel free to see MainMemory's "[Emerald Coast in SA2](https://github.com/MainMemory/SA2EmeraldCoast/tree/master/LevelTest)"
level mod, which includes custom camera setups, rails, custom enemies, and even a custom boss. For more information, please join [the x-hax discord](https://discord.gg/gqJCF47).

## MyLevelMod
The MyLevelMod source code is also included! This project is open source, so please feel free to update or improve the mod if you'd like. If you are a beginner or are simply modifying your own level, its recommended that you stick to one of the other methods- however, if you wonder how certain features were implemented, feel free to check it out!

## Feature Snippets
The files in this folder are code snippets that show you examples of implementing certain features. Feel free to copy them and use them in your own mod.
