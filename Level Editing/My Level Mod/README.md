# My Level Mod
An easy to use level importer for Sonic Adventure 2! Installed as a regular mod, this tool
will give you access to level configuration tools and is built as a template so that anyone
making their own custom level can simply republish the mod to share with others.

Feel free to contribute or message me for any information! J-N-R

## Features
- Support for importing a custom level and texture pack into Sonic Adventure 2.
- Includes a level options file to move options out of code.
- Level options currently support
- * Level start position
- * Level end position
- * Level ID (to choose which level you would like to port over)
- Automatically moves files into the right place for ease of use.

## Future goals
- Add SET file functionality for easy goal ring placement.
- Add Spline functionality for loops / rails.
