# My Level Mod
An easy to use level importer for Sonic Adventure 2! Installed as a regular mod, this tool
will give you access to level configuration tools and is built as a template so that anyone
making their own custom level can simply republish the mod to share with others.

Feel free to contribute or message me for any information! J-N-R
