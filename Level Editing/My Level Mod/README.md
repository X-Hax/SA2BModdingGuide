# My Level Mod
A custom level importer for Sonic Adventure 2! The goal of this project is to allow anyone
to make a level for Sonic Adventure 2 without having to write a single line of code. 
Installed as a regular mod, this tool will give you access to level configuration tools
and is built as a template so that anyone making their own custom level can simply
republish the mod to share with others.

Feel free to contribute or message me for any information! J-N-R
