# Feature Snippets
### Code you can copy and paste into your own mods!

'Commented' versions are better for learning, while uncommented
versions are better for copying.

## Notes
These snippets may have overlapping logic. Your dll file should
have only one 'extern "C"' section, one 'Init' function, etc.
If you need to use the functionality of multiple snippets,
manually merge and include everything under one single version
of the 'extern "C"' section, init functions, etc.
