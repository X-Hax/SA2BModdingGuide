# Feature Snippets
### Code you can copy and paste into your own mods!

'Commented' versions are better for learning, while uncommented
versions are better for copying.

## Notes
If you plan on using multiple snippets, you may end up with overlapping
logic. In that case, simply do your best to try to merge code that are under duplicate
methods together. In the end, you should only have one extern "C" and only one
Init, OnFrame, etc function if any.
